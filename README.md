# RCNN-code

Object detection and counting of tomatoes for further yield estimation by analyzing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) imagery acquired using Low Altitude Remote Sensing (LARS) 
a.	 Implemented R-CNN model for estimation of tomatoes in a given tomato farm. 
b.	The model is based on one of the state-of-the-art CNN-based object detection and classification.
c.	Proposed enhancements over original algorithm â€“ (a) Improved accuracy by selecting the hyper parameters from the epoch that has least loss during training, (b) Refined each bounding box using regression.
